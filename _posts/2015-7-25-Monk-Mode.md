First off, big thanks to Jekyll Now (https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for making this set up nice and easy. For a while now, I've had the intention of starting a blog for myself and I thought as a developer I really shouldn't be just opening a tumbler account (or whatever the kids do now a days) and something about push a blog post just _feels_ right.

Often writing down (or typing) things I learn helps me remember and learn. May this mark the first day of constant learning and improving.

Fixed Program Computer - Do one thing
Stored Program Computer - The instructions are the same as data.
- There is no difference between the input (part of the data) and the steps of the algorithm used to do that
- Programs could produce programs, since programs = data
- Computers themselves were programs - called an **Interpreter**

A programming language provides a set of primitive instructions
- but its the combining mechanism that seperates one language from another

Syntax - Grammar, rules of the knowledge
Static Semantics - Your code has meaning, it does something
Semantics - The meaning

Interpreted vs Compiled

Interpreted - You give it source code, it checks, interpreters and then outputs (spits out errors in your language)

Compiled - Source Code -> Checker -> compiles into object code -> output (spits out error in compiled language)

Compiled runs faster, but slower/harder to code / debug

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - sexy text editor
- Environment that interprets the code (syntax highlighting)
- Debugger

Objects -
